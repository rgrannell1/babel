Babel
===========

> “Let heaven exist, though my own place be in hell. Let me be tortured and battered and annihilated, but let there be one instant, one creature, wherein thy enormous Library may find its justification.”

> - Jorge Luis Borges, The Library of Babel

Babel is a sublime text plugin to help you cope with thy enormous library. More specifically, it opens a file at random from your 
project directory.

Why?

* **1**: Working on random files helps you evenly spread your time between tests, examples and features.
* **2**: Babel will let you inspect the dark-corners of your library that you would have otherwise ignored.
* **3**: Choosing random files will make you work on your favourite and not-so-favourite features.
* **4**: Reading large volumes of code is fruit for existential revelations. [1]
